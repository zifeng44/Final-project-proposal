Footwear Silhouette Generator(P5.js)
It is a drawing pad for footwear designer to get the silhouette inspiration.

Summary
In footwear design, the designer will create a silhouette first and it is super important for the beginning. Designers always looking for inspiring images from the internet, only the creative and unexpected will be the trigger. Iâ€™m also really passionate about footwear design so I want to make this project more valuable and helpful for me. 
I want to create a silhouette generator for designers and specific for footwear design. This generator will be built on P5 as a drawing pad, the user can use their mouse to draw a rough outline and at the same time, the generator will generate some unexpected geometry of lines around it. 
Further, maybe the generator can add some variation bars on the side to let the user change those geometry features.
When the user get the silhouette of what they want, they can save it as image and continue to their work flow.

Component Parts

Challenges
